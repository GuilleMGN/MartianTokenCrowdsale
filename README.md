# MartianTokenCrowdsale

## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected us to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose us to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. We decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)
KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. We’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

Solidity contracts completed using Remix Ethereum IDE. 

We are tasked with the following goals: 

1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
4. Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain

### Things to Do
Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain. 
I am experiencing issues connecting Ganache to MetaMask, once resolved I will run some transactions and upload a video example of evaluation evidence.
